:title: Quick interactables for education with Claude
:draft: true

[.lead]
Claude can now build little interactble tools if you ask it nicely. 

I wanted to explain parabolic arcs to my son, and he's very visual and hands on (though I have every confidence that the maths will be interesting to him soon enough).

I'm a big fan of interactive tools for education. The best ones are small, simple and convey one concept well.

Examples of interactive tools for education include:

* Those delicious buttons at the Science Centre.
