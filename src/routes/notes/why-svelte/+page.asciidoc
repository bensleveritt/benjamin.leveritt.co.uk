= Why Svelte?

I like Svelte because it aligns with my philosophy that technology should serve humans, and not the other way around.

Svelte does all the hard work during compile time, on my computer*, not on yours. When you see content on a React site you're actually downloading the whole compiler to your device, then running it to render the page.

== Is it worth it?

Yes. This site is made with SvelteKit, and honestly it was easy to put together.
